#### pbcs_rep_generator.ipynb

# A draft folder including molecular descriptors. 
# The task is to create physically informed descriptors for machine learning models to predict thermodynamic properties of molecular dynamics simulation data. 
# The starting reference is SLATM representation. These doodles are one of the first steps including 
# translating Fortran code to Python and implementing periodic boundary conditions to consider simulations batter.

# Created using Google colab.

#### yukawa_rep_generator_L1.ipynb

# A draft for Yukawa representation that calculates Yukawa potential with screening term instead of original 3-body term in SLATM representation.

# Created using Google colab.
