# MSc Thesis Notebooks - Liquid Theory Descriptors for ML

Draft notebooks from my master's thesis on physically informed molecular descriptors for predicting thermodynamic properties from molecular dynamics simulations.

## Context
These notebooks document the development of descriptors that bridge molecular simulations with interpretable thermodynamic predictions. 
The work started from SLATM representation and evolved toward Yukawa-based descriptors with physically motivated screening terms.

**Note:** These are working drafts created during research, not polished code. They show the exploration process—testing ideas, comparing approaches, and iterating on implementations.

## Notebooks

### 1. `pbcs_rep_generator.ipynb`
**Periodic Boundary Conditions for SLATM**

Implements SLATM (Spectrum of London and Axilrod-Teller-Muto) representation with periodic boundary conditions. 
This involved translating parts of the original Fortran implementation to Python and adapting it for MD simulation data.

### 2. `yukawa_rep_generator_L1.ipynb`
**Yukawa Descriptor Development**

Explores Yukawa potential with screening term as an alternative to the original 3-body term in SLATM. 
The goal was to create a physically motivated descriptor that better captures liquid-like environments.

### 3. `iso_curves.ipynb`
**Data Analysis: Isotherms and Isobars**

Combines simulation data processing with ML predictions.
Extracts isotherms and isobars from simulation outputs and compares them against theoretical predictions.
Tests Yukawa descriptors against SLATM variants.

### 4. `updated_models_compared.ipynb`
**Descriptor Comparison and Hyperparameter Testing**

Compares three descriptor variants:
- Original SLATM
- SLATM with periodic boundary conditions
- Yukawa-based SLATM

Tests hyperparameters introduced in the Yukawa approach to identify physically relevant features that connect representations to underlying theory.

## Tools & Methods
- Python (NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)
- Scikit-learn for ML models
- Molecular dynamics simulation analysis

All notebooks created using Google Colab.
