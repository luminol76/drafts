#### 1_pbcs_rep_generator.ipynb

# A draft folder including molecular descriptors. 
# The task is to create physically informed descriptors for machine learning models to predict thermodynamic properties of molecular dynamics simulation data. 
# The starting reference is SLATM representation. These doodles are one of the first steps including 
# translating Fortran code to Python and implementing periodic boundary conditions to consider simulations batter.

# Created using Google colab.

#### 2_yukawa_rep_generator_L1.ipynb

# A draft for Yukawa representation that calculates Yukawa potential with screening term instead of original 3-body term in SLATM representation.

# Created using Google colab.

#### 3_iso_curves.ipynb

# This rather long notebook is an unorganized representation of the step where I have tried to gather data and prediction.
# Getting isotherm and isobars from the many simulation data and drawing to curves to see if they fit theory's predictions are combined with 
# machine learning model predictions that use Yukawa descriptor instead of SLATM.
# Although simple in final result, organizing ana analyzing the workflow took some time.

# Created using Google colab.

#### 4_updated_models_compared.ipynb

# This is where the predicted properties come from. Here, original SLATM, periodic boundary conditions SLATM and Yukawa SLATM are compared to each other.
# The learning coming from these descriptors led me to work on hyperparameters introduced in Yukawa and test them to see if they somehow overfit or 
# perform better than the original representations, hopefully showing a physically relevant aspect that connects these representations to simulations, and then to the theory.

# Created using Google colab.
